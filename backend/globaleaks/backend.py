# Here is the logic for creating a twisted service. In this part of the code we
# do all the necessary high level wiring to make everything work together.
# Specifically we create the cyclone web.Application from the API specification,
# we create a TCPServer for it and setup logging.
# We also set to kill the threadpool (the one used by Storm) when the
# application shuts down.
